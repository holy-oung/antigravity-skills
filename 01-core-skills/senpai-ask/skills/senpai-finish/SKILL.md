## Overview

Bring the work to a clean close: show the person it actually runs, confirm the
tests pass, then offer a small set of plain choices and carry out the one they
pick.

**Core principle:** Show it running → confirm tests pass → detect the
environment → present the right (small) set of choices → carry out the choice →
tidy up → save a few lines to memory. Never apply work when tests fail.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using senpai-finish to wrap this up — I'll show you
it working, then you decide what to do with it."

**Say this to the person at the start (plain language):**

> "The work's done in the safe copy. I'll show you it running, make sure the
> automatic checks pass, and then you choose: keep it, or throw it away.
> Nothing touches your real project until you say so."

## Step 1: Show it actually running (for the person)

**A total beginner can't read a test log — but they *can* recognize a screen
that works or output that looks right.** So before anything technical, if the
project has something
you can actually run, run it briefly and show them.

Detect a runnable entry point (skip this step silently if there isn't one, or
if what to run is unclear):

```bash
# Common entry points — use whichever matches the project.
# Node:   npm start / npm run dev / node <entry>
# Python: python main.py / the project's documented run command
# Rust:   cargo run
# Go:     go run .
```

- If it's a short command or script, run it and show the person the output.
- If it's a server or app with a URL, start it, show that it responds (a page,
  a health check, a screenshot if you can), then stop it again.
- Keep it short — a quick "here's it working," not a full demo.

Then say, in plain words, what they're looking at — e.g. "this is your login
screen now checking the password."

**Observe, don't just read.** If the project produces output (a web page, CLI
output, API response), actually look at what it produces — don't just check
whether the command exited successfully. A process can exit 0 and still show a
blank page or wrong data. Tell the person what you *actually see*, not just
that "it ran." If you can take a screenshot, do so — a beginner trusts their
eyes more than a log line.

**If it's clearly broken when you run it,** stop here and tell the person
plainly, before touching the choices. Don't push a visibly broken result toward
"apply."

**If there's nothing runnable, or it's unclear what to run,** skip this step and
rely on the automated tests in Step 2. Don't invent a fake demo.

## Step 2: Confirm the tests pass (the safety gate)

**This is a hard gate and it does not bend.** Run the project's tests once:

```bash
# Use the project's own test command.
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** say so in plain language and stop.

> "The automatic checks are failing (<N> of them). I won't apply this to your
> real project until they pass — that's the safety rule. I'll go back and fix
> it."

Do **not** continue to the choices below. Applying broken work to the real
project is exactly what this gate prevents. (A nice-looking demo in Step 1 does
not override a failing test here — the tests are the gate.) Route back to
`senpai-build` to find and fix the root cause, then return here once tests
pass.

**If tests pass (or the project genuinely has no tests):** continue.

## Step 3: Detect the environment

Two things decide which choices to offer and how tidy-up works: **are we in an
isolated copy, and is there an online home (a remote) for this project?**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)          # empty string = detached HEAD
HAS_REMOTE=$(git remote)                      # empty = no online home
```

**Submodule guard** (same as `senpai-isolate`): `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON` is also
true inside a git submodule. If this prints a path, it's a submodule — treat it
as a normal repo, not an isolated copy:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null
```

Read the state into three facts:

| Fact | How to tell |
|---|---|
| Normal checkout (not an isolated copy) | `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (or submodule), AND no starting-point SHA in `.senpai/log.md` |
| Worked in place (isolate chose not to copy) | `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`, AND `.senpai/log.md` contains a `Starting point:` SHA |
| Isolated copy on a named branch | `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, `BRANCH` non-empty, not a submodule |
| Isolated copy, detached HEAD (externally managed) | `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, `BRANCH` empty |
| Has an online home | `HAS_REMOTE` non-empty |

## Step 4: Find the base branch

Only needed if "apply locally" is on the menu (Step 5). Figure out what this
work branched from:

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

If neither resolves, ask plainly: "This work split off from `main` — is that
right?" Don't guess silently.

## Step 5: Present the choices (kept deliberately small)

For a total beginner, "Pull Request" is an unfamiliar idea, and it only makes
sense at all when the project actually has an online home. So:

- **Only show the "put it online for review" choice when a remote actually
  exists** (`HAS_REMOTE` is non-empty). No remote → drop that choice.
- **The "apply to your real project" choice is available** unless we're on a
  detached HEAD (externally managed — see below).
- **"Decide later" and "Throw it away" are always there.**

Which gives these menus. Present exactly the choices for the matching row —
don't pad them with extra explanation:

| Situation | Choices |
|---|---|
| Normal checkout / isolated copy on a named branch, **remote exists** | Apply · Put online for review · Decide later · Throw away (4) |
| Normal checkout / isolated copy on a named branch, **no remote** | Apply · Decide later · Throw away (3) |
| Detached HEAD, **remote exists** | Put online for review · Decide later · Throw away (3) |
| Detached HEAD, **no remote** | Decide later · Throw away (2) |
| Worked in place (no isolated copy) | Keep as-is · Undo to starting point (2) |

Render it in plain language. For the fullest (4-choice) case:

```
The work is done and the checks pass. What would you like to do?

1. Apply it to your real project
2. Put it online and ask for a review
3. Decide later (I'll leave the copy exactly as it is)
4. Throw this work away

Which one?
```

For the no-remote 3-choice case, drop line 2 and renumber. On a detached HEAD,
drop "Apply it to your real project" (the host manages where this work lands, so
we can't merge it locally). Keep the wording this plain every time.

**Native rendering (optional, your call):** in Claude Code you may present these
same choices with `AskUserQuestion` instead of a numbered list if you prefer —
it's the same choices either way. A plain text menu is completely fine and is
the default. Don't force a tool where a sentence works.

## Step 6: Carry out the choice

### Apply it to your real project (local merge)

```bash
# Move to the real project root first — never merge from inside the copy.
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

git checkout <base-branch>
# Only pull if there's actually an online home to pull from (HAS_REMOTE from
# Step 3) -- running `git pull` with no remote configured is a plain error.
if [ -n "$HAS_REMOTE" ]; then git pull; fi
git merge <feature-branch>

# Re-run the tests on the merged result before trusting it.
<test command>
```

If the merge reports a conflict, stop and explain plainly: "Your original
changed while we were working, so I need to match them up." Resolve it
yourself, re-run the tests, and only continue once tests pass.

Only after the merge succeeds and tests pass on the merged result: tidy up the
copy (Step 7), then delete the branch (`git branch -d <feature-branch>`). Tell
the person plainly: "Done — it's now part of your real project."

### Put it online and ask for a review (needs a remote)

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
```

Then, in plain words: "It's online now. Someone (or you, later) can look it over
before it becomes part of the main project." **Leave the copy in place** — the
person may need it to make changes after the review. Do not tidy it up.

### Undo to starting point (in-place work only)

Only shown when `senpai-isolate` logged a starting-point commit SHA in
`.senpai/log.md` because isolation wasn't possible. Revert all changes back to
that commit (`git revert --no-commit <start-SHA>..HEAD && git commit`). Tell
the person plainly: "I've undone everything back to where we started."

### Decide later (keep as-is)

Change nothing. Say: "I've left everything exactly as it is in the safe copy —
your real project is untouched. We can pick this back up anytime." **Leave the
copy in place.**

### Throw this work away (discard)

**This can't be undone, so confirm first — keep this exact, deliberate step.**
Show what will be lost and require the person to type the word:

```
This will permanently delete this work — you can't get it back:
- the branch <name>
- these saved points: <commit-list>
- the safe copy at <path>

Type '삭제' to confirm.
```

Render the confirmation word in the person's language (e.g. '삭제' in Korean,
'discard' in English, '削除' in Japanese, '删除' in Chinese). Wait for the
person to type that exact word. Anything else means don't
proceed. (This typed confirmation is the one explicit check this toolkit keeps
for an action that can't be reversed — don't soften it into a yes/no or skip it.)

If confirmed:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Save the memory note first (Step 8 — so the *why* survives), then tidy up the
copy (Step 7), then force-delete the branch (`git branch -D <feature-branch>`).

## Step 7: Tidy up the copy

**Only for "Apply" and "Throw away."** "Put online for review" and "Decide
later" always keep the copy alive.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

- **Native exit tool first (Claude Code):** if the copy was made with
  `EnterWorktree`, leave it with the matching native tool **`ExitWorktree`**.
  Running raw `git worktree remove` on a copy the platform created leaves
  phantom state it can't see.
- **`GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** a normal checkout — there's no separate copy to
  remove. Done.
- **Copy lives under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** this toolkit created it, so
  we own removing it. From the real project root:
  ```bash
  MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
  cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
  git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
  git worktree prune   # clean up any stale registration
  ```
- **Anywhere else:** the host environment owns this workspace. Do **not** remove
  it. If the platform has a workspace-exit tool, use that; otherwise leave it be.

## Step 8: Save a few lines to memory

Whatever the person chose — apply, online for review, decide later, or throw
away — end by saving a short wrap-up so the next session knows how this ended.
Follow `senpai-remember`'s schema: append a few plain lines to **`.senpai/log.md`**.
Do not create a new file for this.

The log belongs to the **real** project, not the copy — so it survives even when
the copy is thrown away. As `senpai-remember` does, write to the real root, and
for the "throw away" case write it *before* removing the copy:

```bash
# First entry of `git worktree list` is always the real (main) working tree.
# Use sub() to drop the "worktree " prefix, not $2/awk field-splitting --
# field-splitting truncates any path containing a space (e.g. "My Project").
ROOT=$(git worktree list --porcelain 2>/dev/null | awk '/^worktree /{sub(/^worktree /,""); print; exit}')
# The note goes in "$ROOT/.senpai/log.md".
```

Keep it to the usual few lines — did / decided / next:

```markdown
- Did: finished the login work and applied it to the real project.
- Decided: kept it — demo looked right and all checks passed (user confirmed).
- Next: start on the signup form.
```

**Even when the person throws the work away, record *why*.** A discarded attempt
still teaches something, and the point of memory is to not repeat the same dead
end next time:

```markdown
- Did: tried adding offline mode; threw it away.
- Decided: discarded — it broke the sync tests and the approach was a dead end
  (user agreed). Note: don't retry offline mode without solving sync first.
```

Then tell the person, in plain language, that it's saved — not the raw file.

## Quick Reference

| Choice | Merge | Push | Keep copy | Delete branch | Needs remote |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apply to real project | yes | – | – | yes | – |
| Put online for review | – | yes | yes | – | yes |
| Decide later | – | – | yes | – | – |
| Throw away | – | – | – | yes (force) | – |

| Situation | What changes |
|---|---|
| Tests fail (Step 2) | Stop — no choices offered, nothing applied |
| No runnable entry point | Skip Step 1, rely on tests |
| No remote configured | Drop the "put online for review" choice |
| Detached HEAD | Drop "apply locally"; host manages where it lands |
| Copy under `.worktrees/`/`worktrees/` | We tidy it up (Apply / Throw away only) |
| Copy is host-owned | Never remove it; use a native exit tool if any |

## Common Mistakes

**Applying work when tests fail** — the gate exists exactly to stop this. A good
demo in Step 1 is not a substitute; tests are the gate.

**Skipping the "show it running" step when something *is* runnable** — the demo
is the part a beginner actually understands. Skip it only when there's nothing
to run.

**Offering "put it online for review" with no remote** — the choice makes no
sense without an online home. Drop it.

**Merging from inside the copy** — `git worktree remove` and merges fail or
misbehave when run from inside the copy. `cd` to the real project root first.

**Deleting the branch before removing the copy** — `git branch -d` fails while a
worktree still references the branch. Merge, tidy the copy, *then* delete.

**Tidying up the copy after "Put online" or "Decide later"** — the person needs
it alive. Only "Apply" and "Throw away" tidy up.

**Skipping the typed "discard" confirmation** — it's the one guard against
accidentally deleting work that can't be recovered.

**Forgetting to record *why* on a discard** — the lesson is lost and the same
dead end gets retried later.

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Apply work to the real project when tests fail.
- Merge without re-checking tests on the merged result.
- Throw work away without the typed `discard` confirmation.
- Push or force-push without the person asking for it.
- Remove a copy before confirming the merge succeeded.
- Tidy up a copy you didn't create (only under `.worktrees/`/`worktrees/`).
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the copy being removed.
- Offer the online-review choice when no remote exists.
- Recreate file-level allowlists or approval tokens — isolation plus this one
  keep-or-discard choice is the whole safety model.

**Always:**
- Show it running when you can, before anything technical.
- Confirm tests pass before offering any choice.
- Detect the environment (isolated? remote?) before building the menu.
- Present exactly the choices for the matching situation, in plain words.
- Prefer a native exit tool (`ExitWorktree`) over raw git for cleanup.
- Tidy up the copy for "Apply" and "Throw away" only.
- Save a few plain lines to `.senpai/log.md` at the real project root — always,
  including the *why* on a discard.
