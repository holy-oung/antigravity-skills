# `@hypit/seedance`

Exact Seedance author model module. It owns the request schema and exactly three invocation Surfaces;
it does not contain service credentials, HTTP code, queues, runtime routing or usage-specific Prompt assembly.

The three model invocation shapes are deliberately separate:

- `TextVideo`: Prompt only; this is the only shape that exposes Web Search.
- `FrameVideo`: required first frame and optional last frame.
- `ReferenceVideo`: one or more image, video or audio references within the model's port limits.

All three preserve the remote result as one atomic `GeneratedVideoSet`, then expose its first ordered
member as an ordinary `BlobArtifact`. Their prompt ports consume ordinary `Text`, so a Script projection,
generic Text Template or third-party author module can feed them without becoming part of Seedance.

`standard`, `fast`, `mini` and `2.5` select model variants independently of the invocation shape. Duration is
the author's literal, in whole seconds inside the model's declared range; measure the spoken line first
with `hypit measure` and write the number here. Nothing in the graph computes it, so a Build plan is
complete before it starts.

## Reference audio

The Seedance package rejects reference audio declared as `audio/mp4` or `audio/x-m4a`. Convert the
audio to WAV or MP3 before using it; `media:ExtractAudio` produces WAV and can consume an upstream
component's media output. Renaming a file or changing its declared media type is not conversion.

Known imports are checked during Surface decoding. Future audio stays a graph input and is checked
when its Blob arrives. The same rule applies to drafts, complete requests, planning and direct
generation Producers. `sealSeedanceRequest` uses the endpoint's model-aware request builder;
`seedanceComponent` and `seedanceDefinition.component` expose the same implementation.

This checks the Blob's declared media type, not its bytes or codec. The selected Provider remains
responsible for any additional service-specific input limits.

## Visual reference metadata

Declare whether each image or video contains a person/avatar reference, including an AI-generated
human likeness. This describes the supplied material, independently of the prompt's requested action:

```xml
<seedance:ReferenceVideo id="dance" model="mini" prompt={direction} duration="8">
  <seedance:Reference image={presenter.image} person-reference="true"/>
  <seedance:Reference video={motion.video} person-reference="true"/>
  <seedance:Reference image={room.image} person-reference="false"/>
</seedance:ReferenceVideo>
```

`person-reference` is optional, accepts literal `true` or `false`, and applies to image/video, not
voice audio. Omission carries no classification; it is distinct from explicitly declaring false.
Inspect the actual reference when deciding the value. For `FrameVideo`, use
`first-frame-person-reference` and `last-frame-person-reference` beside their respective frame
inputs. A last-frame classification requires a last-frame input.

| Supplied visual input | Authored attribute | Request port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Each `Reference image={...}` | `person-reference` | `referenceImage` |
| Each `Reference video={...}` | `person-reference` | `referenceVideo` |
| `FrameVideo` first frame | `first-frame-person-reference` | `firstFrame` |
| `FrameVideo` last frame | `last-frame-person-reference` | `lastFrame` |

These forms apply to `standard`, `fast`, `mini` and `2.5`. For example:

```xml
<seedance:FrameVideo id="turn" model="fast" prompt={direction} duration="5"
  first-frame={presenter.image} first-frame-person-reference="true"
  last-frame={empty-room.image} last-frame-person-reference="false"/>
```

Classify the material supplied to this request, not the intended result. A dance video with a person
still needs `true` when used only for motion, even if the prompt asks for a different performer.
An empty room stays `false` when the prompt asks to add a person. Inspect video across the selected
excerpt, not only its opening frame. This flag neither detects faces nor locks or names an identity.
Identity and action direction remain in the prompt and references.

The SVML author declares this parameter on each reference input. Admitted files, generated
images/videos and reused Results use the same attributes. For a future output, declare the intended
reference classification explicitly; if its contents are uncertain, generate and inspect that
material before using it downstream.

The model's media ports carry this as `fields.personReference`. Providers interpret it through their
service's media handling; it is not a prompt sentence or a Core-level identity. HypiHub sends it as
`is_person_reference` when uploading the file, then uses the returned URL in the ordinary video
request. A project Provider maps it according to its own API.
Omission does not request automatic face detection. HypiHub currently treats omitted upload flags
as unmarked (`false`); declare `true` explicitly for a person reference that needs its preparation.

Video references can carry motion or camera behavior while image references carry the target
appearance. Request duration and reference-clip duration are different limits. Check the selected
Endpoint's reference duration and media limits when choosing an excerpt; the author's output duration
alone does not validate the input clip.
